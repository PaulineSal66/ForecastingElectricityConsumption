# Forecasting Electricity Consumption

## Project

This project has been done in a context of Time Series Analysis class at Data ScienceTech Institute.

The file Elec-train.xlsx contains electricity consumption (kW) and outdoor air temperature for one building. 

These quantities are measured every 15 minutes, from 1/1/2010 1:15 to 2/17/2010 23:45. 

In addition, outdoor air temperature are available for 2/18/2010. 


## Goal
The goal is to forecast electricity consumption (kW) for 2/18/2010. For that, there are two strategies:

- PART 1. the first one without using outdoor temperature, 
- PART 2. the second one using outdoor temperature.
